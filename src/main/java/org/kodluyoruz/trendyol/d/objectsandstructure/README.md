- Hide internal structure.
- Prefer data structures.
- Avoid hybrids structures (half object and half data).
- Should be small.
- Do one thing.
- Small number of instance variables.
- Base class should know nothing about their derivatives.
- Better to have many functions than to pass some code into a function to select a behavior.
- Prefer non-static methods to static methods.
