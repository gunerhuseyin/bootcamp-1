 int sum;
 
 int day;

String nameString;

String name;

String personName; 

What is differences?

- Use Pronounceable Names

Date tmstmp;

Date timeStamp;

kill()



- DONâ€™T PUN

Avoid using the same word for two different purposes.  Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially pun.

**For example**, if you have two classes having the same add() method.  In one class, it performs addition of two values, in another it inserts an element into list.  So, choose wisely, in the second class use insert() or append() instead of add().


One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king.  Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand
